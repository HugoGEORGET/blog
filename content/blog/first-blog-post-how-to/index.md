## Introduction

Hi there !
I don't know if this blog will be updated often but here I go !

What better way to start my blog than by explaning how it works ?

This blog was built using the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) starter.  
[**GatsbyJS**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator using the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework. This framework allows us to easily deploy our site to various platforms, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or in our case [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/).

## Prerequisites

If you want to do the same, here is what you need :

- A version of [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)>=8.11.3
- The [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli). Follow the link for instruction on how to install
- A free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
